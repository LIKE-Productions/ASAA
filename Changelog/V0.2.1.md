# Changelog for ASAA Version 0.2.1

## Message
Thank you for being with me up until this point. This release is by far the hardest to execute, mainly because I wasted a lot of time working in the wrong ideas. I was very close to creating a new major release, but [symantic versioning](https://semver.org/) told me that only non-backwards compatible changes deserve a new **MAJOR** version. Of course, I did change a few things, so I will list them soon.


## Dependencies
I added Pandas for ease of access from the user.


## Changes

I am terribly sorry, but we have finally integrated Pandas DataFrames :satisfied:! 

Now, I garuntee some outrage, but I made the export format to Microsoft Excel Open XML files(XLSX) :scream:, which means you might get an error saying ``ImportError: No module named 'openpyxl'``, simply type in the terminal ``pip3 install openpyxl``. It should work after. 

After you enter in data, your screen spits out a much nicer looking image: ![pd Image](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4m9U1K2w4WCK95EqMTtzLMUXlpg9T8Z-ipVYwLlUGGDpkgEYe1Z9tAkBKx3QNJOKXcDBYRcd0c1vzf5ecXKn87WzsurAayOsPR-JN-Pzi0LsO1LJFUS5S4Kd4JHvRoABuXkg1b0BIWDWpMeNU1wTjYoDwvhsvpx9EniAjvGb_3mk8PToY-2ohPDlUi2A-AghWx?width=293&height=123&cropmode=none)

Of course, you see that all the databases now have "left" as their handiness instead of "l", and there is a new column for distance. Here is how the document looks on Excel 2019:

### Code Level Changes

> These changes are not noticable in the program but are different inside the code.

```python
# New function!!
    def b_setup(self):
        global count
        count = len([name for name in os.listdir(".") if os.path.isfile(name)])
        wincd = "asaa_logs"
        unixcd = "asaa_logs"
        if platform.system() == 'Windows' and not os.path.exists(wincd):
            os.mkdir(wincd)
            os.chdir(wincd)
            count
        elif platform.system() == 'Windows' and os.path.exists(wincd):
            os.chdir(wincd)
            count
        elif platform.system() == 'Linux' and not os.path.exists(unixcd):
            os.mkdir(unixcd)
            os.chdir(unixcd)
            count
        else:
            os.chdir(unixcd)
            count

        count = len([name for name in os.listdir(".") if os.path.isfile(name)])
```
```python
# Removed dbvar.pop(-1)!! Also add self variable to every method.
if time == 0:
    
    dbobj = {
        "author": auth,
        "handiness": left_or_right,
        "distance": distance,
        "numbers": dbvar
    }

    self.b_setup()
    df = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(dbobj)
    
    df.to_excel(f"thr_time{count}.xlsx", index=False)
    print(df)
    break
else:
    tcon = 16.67*time/1000
    throwing_time = distance / tcon * 3.6
dbvar.append(throwing_time)

lr_id = asaa.insert_one(dbobj).inserted_id
```
