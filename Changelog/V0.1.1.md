# Changelog for ASAA Minor Release 0.1.1
>Note that this is a minor release. Additions are explained here, but not the main feature.

## Changes

The biggest change from a developer perspective is the fact I made the left and right hands a single function. I also added authors and made the databases accessible. With that, the list I made earlier:

- ~~Adding functions for left and right hands to make it DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)~~
- ~~Add a while loop to the question asking for your handiness.~~
- ~~Adding author name for reference~~
- ~~Making databases accessible to more people than me.~~
- Many, many more improvments.

Is suddenly empty. Except that one surprise I was talking about. You will never figure out what it is.
