# Changelog for ASAA Version 0.1 Alpha 1

## Message
I am happy to announce that we are finally releasing ASAA Version 0.1 Alpha 1. This is the first public release of ASAA, and is a dream I have been trying to accomplish for quite some time now. Anyways, here is an overview of the changes I have made for ASAA Version 0.1 Alpha 1. 
# Main Changes

## Overview
Our first big change is the programming language we are using. I have decided on Python since it has a huge Data Science base.

## Dependencies
The only dependencies you need to download yourself is PyMongo.

## How the program works
If you would rather read than experiment yourself, this is where you'll find it. I will include code snippets of the code and a few screenshots.

When you run the program, you are greeted with:

![Start question](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4m7qHrwM__17r_CfJFXasf0Ghdk5ZJECpLqrL6ONABA1S6d9b0R3ldxj6CPMLd5bX9U0qmj5xyJx8Mf8n8rF5pPmL4l416msFcthmX3H_D7Q2kxapm48RdYPCYhZLSngZKGEV6nl9QnIpu1yfPPjug0a-VkKgwRc0ChUNQA0btJMy0LPyZQQszlZ09WMet-Yg_?width=458&height=19&cropmode=none)

```python
left_right = int(input("Are you left handed or right handed? 0 for left, 1 for right: "))
```

>I threw 15 pitches with both hands and will present the first 6 of the right hand.

Then, you will present your data when the program asks:

![Second Question](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4m5ht0-iG1vB8FsCs9I5Q7RSOIq4wwcRPllW77Xzb76vWbi1yRYSHccWv9g88pUJ_UbQZZMh27DQ-kntOGNIz3FjI9BMfa6WcC5PhnLR5W5GEYASo8QjdDNOb7pmmQdlnt1os15dChJDIcYMGoC0bMATKorJyEKde3NdcsqJjPmQErAbRAigs5UWAHtif53d2u?width=594&height=16&cropmode=none)

```python
right = int(input("Name one throwing time you have. When you have entered in all your times, type in 0: "))
```
Here is my data:

![My data](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4mMfFcT-7PQRM16kJQdiofeY1PwEGS5_Acgm79MAeCOEs8lPnFLRCER9JZWhCdnw1zISS0F8afEQB-4tqYrYyqVFxAA3lIASiYmFkaMBgGPCR1886LZfoXilCUsJXbR7WELec2ls9IUcl1BQoyCp0s8Yravwaxtzwna_weRdESOuvW6cKvBB1TI4T1MhYoM6lG?width=622&height=121&cropmode=none)

When you have entered in all the throwing times you want to enter, type 0. The last change I made before writing the documentation was popping the last 0 at the end with a simple ```.pop(-1)``` command. 

The code for the left and right hands are barely different. Here is what the left hand code looks like: 
```python
if left_right == 0:
    left_right = 0
    print("Times should be posted in 60 fps. To convert 30 fps to 60 fps, take your number and multiply it by two.")
    
    while True:
        left = int(input(
            "Name one throwing time you have. When you have entered in all your times, type in 0: "))
        aleft.append(left)

        if left == 0:
            False
            aleft.pop(-1)
            dbleft = {
                "handiness": "left",
                "numbers": aleft
            }
            break
    left_id = asaa.insert_one(dbleft).inserted_id
```
The only difference between the left and right is that variables with 'left' in them are 'right'.

When you finish entering in all your data and enter 0, it is sent to my database. I am going to have a way of accessing this data that I will explain later, but for now only I can see it. 

It looks like this:

# What's next?

Considering this is purely an Alpha 1 Version of ASAA, it is doomed to have error, bugs, and not have very efficent code. Her is a list of stuff I am going to add in future versions of ASAA(Hopefully sooner than later!)

1. Adding functions for left and right hands to make it DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself)
2. Add a while loop to the question asking for your handiness.
3. Adding author name for reference
4. Making databases accessible to more people than me.
5. Many, many more improvments.

I am happy I have no Pylance errors though. 

:innocent:

# Conclusion
To conclude this Version, better known as 0.1.1, we have finally created our promised ASAA. I hope to do the changes that were listed in the What's Next section. Note that I have intentionally left out my biggest change to create an element of surprise. It probably won't come out for another 2 or 3 months, but it will be the biggest change to this puny app*.

*A hint of what the change is.

Thank you for choosing ASAA,

Magnus Peterson Munoz, CEO of LIKE Productions and head engineer of ASAA.
