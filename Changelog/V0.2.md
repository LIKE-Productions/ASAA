# Changelog for ASAA Version 0.2

## Message
Thank you for supporting me to get to this point. This release is 10x better than the first release. Everything is way more human readable, and databases are easier to access than ever. The code is way more DRY than the last release, and etectra etectra. Many changes were added, which requires a new "How the program works" page.

## Dependencies
This time, I recommend you install three dependencies. Pymongo, and pandas. While pandas isn't being used right now, I will explain my thinking near the bottom of this CHANGELOG.

## How the program works
If you would rather read than experiment yourself, this is where you'll find it. I will include code snippets of the code and a few screenshots.

When you run the program, you are greeted with:

![author](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4msSxjQBcbA1mNtkrfZdTwwdmqxx0odgroFUynQos1OSuuAPS3kGEMSMAxoT2Uo5W0A9ksc66ATjjAh6dTSfCULRSfFJo6hGI5zY4Uvv-g9M-o13_KublGyH-vq2L5nIq1hVBwge0yhHRYBwzA7bpTLJAyyW0wF1HGoTQPPSDNpv17VjWEnq1ixSUaI0mr6xIi?width=311&height=35&cropmode=none)

```python
def author():
    global auth
    auth = input("What is your name?(Used for access purposes)\n")
```

This information is also used to lookup your past times. This is why the question is first.

After that, you are asked: 

![new or old](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4mrWbNToBGTa2b_ywW0t5gvgKCtg2ejji8SxwsaGdPXKvoa2UUPdshc7FoUnnQFqLt2L0Qc-VPChmMrukE3rvNzrGeajSym4XqYRTgOI7hpvlmaXgPvexuEtqJsLGvWWza3l7mnuro8NWObrfICYVXqjul26Gvd8jzvJhdMi6ArBcXpgVKAWNa9J_CRC9OqkEq?width=421&height=19&cropmode=none)

```python
big_question = input(
    "Do you want to enter in new data(y) or see old data(n)?: ")
```
If you type in 'y' or 'yes' or 'yabbordoodle', you will be asked something different from last time.

![distance](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4maSKj3YQbt3-b5MAQkR_zd8BDBL0jF3xvT1kSasqv9ZKFAiViUZ69fiN-NeiWdMzHFuhbSJl5s8SDqkx691-I7sHOWTPA0BCKNK1AwG-0vU218cZvOJSOsGjUDAn0A4WMdUw825YUYgjT8uFjDOi7RbIyu4G8GXE-lO78dm7Yk_-Eluogno9m7l-QP-hwTf_2?width=710&height=19&cropmode=none)

```python
distance = float(input("What is the distance you threw your throws from? Use meters(to convert cm to m, divide by 100): "))
```

> I threw 15 pitches from 4.49 meters with my left hand. I am presenting the first 6.

![throws](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4mUdzHcDabH3TMuv5fLiju3jA-qKUUXk0389gXEu3oRQVmta0FhXy0f_kOu0YK-8HPqi-Gpn4GF-HVnZRciZzOGb1sMKHP2PJ4yYBa7tsH8VAf9iLm32sKyxq8pw_ZGkhtiUZyJkkp4800ldoGB9X83G9HguT9j6PR4Wnyde0ZqstFkgZAmNB5uqWwj4w0Tt5N?width=621&height=124&cropmode=none)

Entire function:
```python
def questions(left_or_right):
    left_or_right = left_right
    print("Times should be posted in 60 fps. To convert 30 fps to 60 fps, take your number and multiply it by two.")

    distance = float(input("What is the distance you threw your throws from? Use meters(to convert cm to m, divide by 100): "))
    while True:
        time = float(input(
            "Name one throwing time you have. When you have entered in all your times, type in 0: "))
        
        if time == 0:
            False
            dbvar.pop(-1)
            dbobj = {
                "author": auth,
                "handiness": left_or_right,
                "numbers": dbvar
            }
            break
        else:
            tcon = 16.67*time/1000
            throwing_time = distance / tcon * 3.6
        dbvar.append(throwing_time)

    lr_id = asaa.insert_one(dbobj).inserted_id
```

Now we are asked:

![yes_or_no](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4mX6k9kd9K3dKnPf8FPmkaZkMUwP2M69I3IQ8iWmPIH2W3R6tgommZOAY8Uyy3njsz045u1Bd9EuRyjO6oHVI8RPleYd-yXqI6PDsLXdImL9Psj0oJXyRjoZIo3Dz9NkxSX8ZEeAPF28aKpoTc9JD_VtZmidrFM5IDFxspBCp6peX-MmW018LfygG8BY-eek0L?width=480&height=21&cropmode=none)

```python
 another_question = input(
    "Do you want to see your data after you enter in more data? (y/n): ")
if another_question.startswith('y') == True:
    find_docs()
else:
    pass
```

You will now get results right from the database.

```python
def find_docs():
    for query in asaa.find({"author": auth}):
        pprint.pprint(query)
```

Saying no will exit out of the program without showing your results.

Of course, the opposite can also happen.
![Right away](https://bn1301files.storage.live.com/y4mDKuq_K-mg45O4EaMP9sbF_cMir5yI9hD2Y5V5iL2kcxC7TBnK8jnBAcuPzrb-gSUS4kGRH7fSmOpexw9SpFarlt7EXcnaU4yqVsizJZVfPIKd29FnbpVXj7LqFS3jLSpI0TH1Lz6ZfcvybUB1AusPd8E-8XMg1-vNup_mzhDGvWoadnz-X0iA3Js5IbDqIy3?width=420&height=152&cropmode=none)


The full function is: 
```python
big_question = input(
    "Do you want to enter in new data(y) or see old data(n)?: ")

if big_question.startswith('y') == True:
    while left_right.startswith('r') or left_right.startswith('l') == False:
        left_right = input(
            "Are you left handed or right handed? l for left, r for right: ")

        if left_right.startswith('r') or left_right.startswith('l') == True:
            questions(left_right[0])

            break
    another_question = input(
        "Do you want to see your data after you enter in more data? (y/n): ")
    if another_question.startswith('y') == True:
        find_docs()
    else:
        pass
else:
    find_docs()
```


# What's Next

I am working quite hard on the big update I am promising. For updates, go to my Twitter, which is [@YapperPm](https://twitter.com/YapperPm) by the way. The one minor update I might make is turning the speed calculation into a function to unclutter my code. I will also work on better explaining my app inside the Python script. Still no PyLance or pylint errors, however.
:innocent:

# Conclusion
To conclude, this release is major, and a big change. However, it will not be the biggest. Stay tuned to the new release.
