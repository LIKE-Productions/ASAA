# ASAA

## Description
ASAA is a simple app that aims to create a shot accruacy program using a Microsoft Kinect and an optional projector.

## Language
We are hoping to be able to use Python as our main language mainly because it is widely compatible with many devices. I am currently running the code on a Raspberry Pi.

# Development process
This is the place where I explain the development process.

I am happy to announce that we are finally releasing ASAA Version 0.1 Alpha 1. This is the first public release of ASAA, and is a dream I have been trying to accomplish for quite some time now. Anyways, here is an overview of the changes I have made for ASAA Version 0.1 Alpha 1. 
# Main Changes

## Overview
Our first big change is the programming language we are using. I have decided on Python since it has a huge Data Science base.

## Dependencies
The only dependencies you need to download yourself is PyMongo. Note that the password shown in the code is not my account password, and I also have two factor authentication enabled (unlike a certain CEO).

# Conclusion
To conclude this Version, better known as 0.1.1, we have finally created our promised ASAA. I hope to do the changes that were listed in the [What's Next](/Changelog/V0.1A.md#What's-Next) section.

Thank you for choosing ASAA,

Magnus Peterson Munoz, CEO of LIKE Productions and head engineer of ASAA.
