# ASAA

## Description
ASAA is my long awaited dream of creating an app that measures the speed of your baseball throw.

## Programming Language
We will be using Python as our language for a few reasons.

1. I am experienced in Python
1. It works great on a Raspberry Pi
1. Extensive library support for tools I need.
1. Great Data Science userbase

## Abbreiviated Changelog for ASAA Version 0.2

>This is a snippet of the full Changelog. You can view the full Changelog by clicking [here](https://github.com/LIKE-Productions/ASAA/blob/main/Changelog/V0.2.md).

### Message
Thank you for supporting me to get to this point. This release is 10x better than the first release. Everything is way more human readable, and databases are easier to access than ever. The code is way more DRY than the last release, and etectra etectra. Many changes were added, which requires a new "[How the program works](https://github.com/LIKE-Productions/ASAA/blob/main/Changelog/V0.2.md#how-the-program-works)" page.

### Dependencies
All you need is Pymongo, but stay tuned because you soon might need pandas.

### How to run the program
If you were wondering about how to run this program, note there are no parameters you must fill in; there are zero parameters, in fact.

```shell
python main.py
```

### Tested versions

I write my code on Python 3.8, but I think 3.9, 3.7 and 3.6 should work. Python 3.5 won't work because I use f-strings, a feature created in 3.6 and greater.

## Version 0.2.1
ASAA Version 0.2.1 is an improved version of Version 0.2. Check both out for clarity.

### What's Next
I am working quite hard on the big update I am promising. For updates, go to my Twitter, which is [@YapperPm](https://twitter.com/YapperPm) by the way. The one minor update I might make is turning the speed calculation into a function to unclutter my code. I will also work on better explaining my app inside the Python script. Still no PyLance or pylint errors, however. :innocent:

### Conclusion
To conclude, this release is major, and a big change. However, it will not be the biggest. Stay tuned to the new release.

# ¡¡Update!!
I am currently working on new logos for the LIKE and ASAA brand. Updates will be on Twitter. Here are a few pictures.

Although I know these are not the best logos, I am working to create better logos in the future. 

Thank you for choosing ASAA,
